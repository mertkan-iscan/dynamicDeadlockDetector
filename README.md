# Java Thread Deadlock Detection & Log Analysis Suite

A Java-based simulation and analysis toolkit for detecting thread deadlocks, managing resources, and processing log data. The project provides utilities to simulate thread behavior, resource acquisition, and deadlock scenarios, with additional capabilities for logging and analysis.

## Features

- Thread Simulation: Simulate the creation and execution of multiple threads with customizable behaviors.
- Deadlock Detection: Identify potential deadlocks in multi-threaded resource acquisition scenarios.
- Resource Management: Manage resources and their allocation to different threads.
- Navigation & Visualization: Navigate resource graphs to analyze thread dependencies and cycles.
- Logging: Log thread activities and events for further inspection.
- Log Processing: Parse and analyze log files to identify patterns and issues.

## File Overview

- `DeadlockDetectionWithNavigation.java` - Main driver for simulating threads and detecting deadlocks. Provides navigation features for resource graphs.
- `GraphInfo.java` - Manages the dependency/resource graph and supports traversal for deadlock analysis.
- `Resource.java` - Represents a resource in the simulation, tracking its state and the thread that holds it.
- `TestSpaceManager.java` - Coordinates test environment setup and the overall simulation space for threads and resources.
- `ThreadLogger.java` - Handles logging of thread activity and resource events.
- `ThreadTestSpace.java` - Simulates thread behavior and interaction with resources.
- `LogProcessor.java` - Processes log files generated by the simulation for further analysis.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

## Compilation

Use the following command in the root project directory:
javac *.java

## Running

1. Run the main deadlock simulation (replace class name if necessary):
java DeadlockDetectionWithNavigation

2. Process logs after running simulations:
java LogProcessor path/to/logfile.log

## Usage

- The main program simulates threads acquiring and releasing resources.
- The system can intentionally create deadlocks to test detection logic.
- Logs are generated for all thread actions and resource events.
- The log processor parses and summarizes the results.

## Example

javac *.java
java DeadlockDetectionWithNavigation
java LogProcessor thread_logs.txt
